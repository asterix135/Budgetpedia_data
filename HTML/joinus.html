<h1>Help us Make Budgetpedia Better!</h1>

<p>
    Budgetpedia is a volunteer-driven project.  We've gotten where we are thanks
    to people with a wide variety of backgrounds and expertise.  If you're
    interested in democratizing information on municipal budgets in Ontario,
    we'd love to have you join us.
</p>
