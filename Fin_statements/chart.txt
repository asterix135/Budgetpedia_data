For 2013 and 2014

1) Used downloaded pdfs of city consolidated financial statements in gdrive/Budgetpedia/Research/Budget Datasets/Dataset Series 4 (Statements of Revenue and Expenses)
2) For each pdf, manually transcribe data from 'Consolidated Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus' to csv file (chart is an image file, and OCR pretty much fails)
3) In transcription, keep only year's actual data (ignore Budget column and previous year's restated column)
4) Create 2 different csv files - one for Revenue items, one for Expense items


For 2015, 2012 - 1999

1) Used downloaded pdfs of city consolidated financial statements in gdrive/Budgetpedia/Research/Budget Datasets/Dataset Series 4 (Statements of Revenue and Expenses)
2) For each year, copy either expense or revenue section from 'Consolidated Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus' to a txt file
3) Parse using parse_copied_text.py  (command line: python3 parse_copied_text.py input_file_name output_file_name optional:index_value)
4) Note any error messages, and double-check output file
4a) NOTE That for 2002 and earlier, there is some manual correction needed for copy/paste and to correct for negative numbers due to the 'Deduct: taxation relating to school boards' item
5) Do this for both expense and revenue section

For 1998
same as previous, but because there are no commas, script fails,
So copy/paste values in
